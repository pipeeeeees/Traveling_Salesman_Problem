# Traveling Sales Man

For those who do not know about the traveling salesman, imagine you are a salesperson with the goal of hitting up a dozen retail stores to sell your brand new product: the macrophone! Like a microphone, but on a macro scale...

# ANYWAYS

You are frugal, and want to drive to each store and back while using the least amount of gas. In which order should you go to hit every point on your journey while using the least amount of gas? That is the queston.

You COULD try every permutation of locations until you brute-forcingly find the answer... but this takes too long, and time is money. So how else do you go about optimizing your distance traveled vs time calculating a good answer?

Well this public repo showcases my attempts to solve this problem in my spare time. Enjoy!
